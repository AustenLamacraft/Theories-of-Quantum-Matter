# Theories of Quantum Matter

Material for a Part III Physics course at the University of Cambridge, running in Michaelmas 2016.

1. `docs` contains the files for the Jekyll site, currently living [here](http://tqm.courses.phy.cam.ac.uk/docs/).

2. `notebooks` contains some Jupyter notebooks used to produce some of the figures.

## To Do

1. Background charge density in Jellium lecture handled correctly?

1. Improve discussion of fractional statistics

1. Question on condensate fluctuations (essentially in my atoms notes)

1. Sawada for plasmons

1. Question on Majumdar--Ghosh

1. Luttinger model: density matrix of left movers when right movers traced out.

1. Structure factor from scattering of a particle from density fluctuations.

1. Issue of $\sqrt{n(x)}e^{i\theta(x)}$ vs. $e^{i\theta(x)}\sqrt{n(x)}$.
