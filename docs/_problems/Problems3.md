## $N(\bk)$ in the Ground State

In second order perturbation theory, find the occupation number $N(\bk)=\braket{0}{\adop_{\bk,s}\aop_{\bk,s}}{0}$ in the ground state of the interacting Fermi gas. Compare with the quantity $z_\bk$ introduced in the lecture.

## Pair Correlations in the BCS State

As well as the average occupancy of a given momentum state we can consider the correlations between
the occupancy of different $\bp$ states

$$
C_{ss'}(\bp,\bp')\equiv\langle n_{\bp,s} n_{\bp',s'}\rangle-\langle n_{\bp,s}\rangle\langle n_{\bp',s'}
$$

Show that for the BCS state

$$
C_{\uparrow\downarrow}(\bp_1,\bp_2)&=&\delta_{\bp_1,-\bp_2}u_{\bp_1}^2v_{\bp_1}^2=\delta_
{\bp_1,-\bp_2}\frac{|\Delta|^2}{4E_{\bp_1}^2}\nonumber\\
\cC_{\uparrow\uparrow}(\bp_1,\bp_2)&=&\delta_{\bp_1,\bp_2}\frac{|\Delta|^2}{4E_{\bp_1}^2}
$$

Interpret these two expressions.
