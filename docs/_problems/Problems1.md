## Calogero-Sutherland Model

Ground state wavefunction

## Impurity in Impenetrable Gas

## Yrast States of Rotating Gas

## Oddity of the Plasma analogy

We could define the potential of the background charge

## Evolution of the Laughlin state under harmonic confinement

## Density matrix of the $\nu=1$ state

Behaviour at the edge

## Holes in the $\nu=1$ state

Confirm that

$$
\Psi_\text{hole}(z_1,\ldots, z_N|Z) = \prod_j (Z-z_j)\Psi_{m=1}(z_1,\ldots, z_N).
$$

can be formed from a superposition of single hole states in the Fermi sea

## Improving the plasma picture

Adding finite screening length by allowing for entropy...

## Ground state of the attractive Lieb--Liniger model

Show the explicit form of the ground state and demonstrate that this is of Bethe form, identifying the Bethe momenta in this case.

Relate to bright soliton -- captures leading order ground state energy (and mass, but that's easy)

## Peirels instability

## Diagonalize quadratic Hamiltonian for general two particle potential

## Quantize the 2D oscillator problem

## Optical phonons?

Double the size of the unit cell?

Model of a displacive phase transition

## Fluctuations of a mass in a finite chain

Investigate the behaviour of $\bra{0} u_j^2\ket{0}$ in a chain of length $N$. What happens as $N\to\infty$?

## Thermal displacement in 2D

Show that we get divergence of displacement in thermal equilibrium

## Excited States: Feynman--Bijl Formula

## Nonlinearity and Interactions

Introduce terminology of _free theory_

## From Schwinger Bosons to Holstein--Primakoff


Where does the Holstein--Primakoff representation come from?

[Jordan--Schwinger representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_map)

## Hartree-Fock Energy of Magnons

## Spin Waves from Bogoliubov Transformation

Write the Heisenberg model in terms of $\aop_j$ $\adop_j$ operators...

## Classical Spin Waves

Following Faddeev

## Spin wave calculation with anisotropy

## Proof of no LRO based on sum rules



## The Simple Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP)

Show the relationship between generator and Heisenberg
