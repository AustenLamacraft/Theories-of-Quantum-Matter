## Ground state of the attractive Lieb--Liniger model

Show the explicit form of the ground state and demonstrate that this is of Bethe form, identifying the Bethe momenta in this case.

Relate to bright soliton -- captures leading order ground state energy (and mass, but that's easy)

## Diagonalize quadratic Hamiltonian for general two particle potential

## Quantize the 2D oscillator problem

## Optical phonons?

Double the size of the unit cell?

Model of a displacive phase transition

## Thermal displacement in 2D

Show that we get divergence of displacement in thermal equilibrium

## From Schwinger Bosons to Holstein--Primakoff

## The Simple Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP)

Show the relationship between generator and Heisenberg
