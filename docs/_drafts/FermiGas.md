## Perturbation Theory

For this part follow Lifshitz Pitaevskii

### Spectrum From Perturbation Theory

Label states with occupation numbers
Chemical potential, effective mass

F-function.

This extends the HF analysis, which wouldn't alter effective mass, say.  

### Eigenstates in Perturbation theory

Quasiparticle residue
1D case as special (no residue)

$N_k$ and its jump.

### Collisions

Usual argument for vanishing collisions based on kinematics

## Landau Fermi Liquid

Argument from Galilean invariance for effective mass.

### Collective modes?

### Spectral function?

Interpret in terms of probability to stay in state.
