<p class="message">
In our study of spin models we've encountered the 'curse of dimensionality' in quantum many-body physics: the dimension of the Hilbert space increases exponentially with the size of the system. Although this makes our prospects look rather bleak, we've already encountered situations where much more can be said.

## The Tensor Product

We haven't dwelled on it in the examples discussed so far, but perhaps the first question in formulating a problem of quantum many-body physics is: _in what space does the state of such a system live_? Let's consider a state of $N$ spin-1/2s, just as we had in [Lecture 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures/SpinModels/).
