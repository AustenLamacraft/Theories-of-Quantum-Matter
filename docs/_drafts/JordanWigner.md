## Spins _vs._ Fermions

Here we introduce..

### Solving the XY Model

### Spin Correlations



## Bosonization

Lukyanov has careful bosonization

Lieb / Schultz / Mattis

Follow Luther Peschel

Use bosonic operators to show how we can represent spin operators in a chain.


No long range order in the XY model.
