<p class="message">
We have seen that product states can be described in terms of their occupation numbers. We now introduce a language to describe many body states, and the operators that act on them, that is adapted to this description. This method of <strong> second quantization </strong> represents the beginning of the field theoretic description of many body systems.

## Recap: Product States

Remember that in [Lecture 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures/ManyBodyWavefunctions/) we saw that a normalized product state of $M$ bosons occupying orthonormal states $\varphi_{\alpha_n}(\br)$ $n=1,\ldots, M$ is

$$
\Psi^{\text{S}}_{\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\cdots\alpha_{M}}(\br_1,\ldots,\br_M)=\sqrt{\frac{M!}{\prod_{\alpha}N_{\alpha}!}}\mathcal{S}\,\varphi_{\alpha_{1}}(\mathbf{r}_{1})\varphi_{\alpha_{2}}(\mathbf{r}_{2})\cdots\varphi_{\alpha_{M}}(\mathbf{r}_{M}),
$$

where

$$
 \label{quantum_statistics_SymAntisym}
   \mathcal{S}=\frac{1}{N!}\sum_{P} P
$$

is the operation of symmetrization. The normalization factor involves the __occupation numbers__ $\{N_{\alpha}\}$ giving the number of particles in state $\alpha$.



Product states and matrix elements.

Hark back to quantization of the elastic chain. We identify those with bosons
