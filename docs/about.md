## Models of Matter

It's important to realise that in general simple models are neither tractable, nor display simple behaviour! To take an example: all students of physics are familiar with the Ising model of magnetism, which caricatures a lattice of magnetic ions, together with their complex interactions. Now, I want to make two points about this model, which are common to the approach I'm talking about:
First, there are certain quantitative aspects of the transition (e.g. the critical exponents) that are universal, meaning that they coincide with those of real magnetic phase transitions. Stranger still, the same features are present at the critical points of all liquid gas transitions, even though boiling and magnetising seem to have little in common at first glance.
Second, while we can calculate the transition temperature of the Ising model analytically in 2D, only numerical estimates are available in 3D. In fact, there are good reasons to believe an analytical calculation in 3D is impossible!
This illustrates that the Ising model captures both the phenomenology of magnetic ordering (and phase transitions more generally) and its complexity. You should think of models of this kind -- statistical physics and many body physics are full of them -- as minimal working examples that show us the essential ingredients needed for a phenomenon to occur. In the case of the Ising model these ingredients boil down to (1) a local variable that be positive or negative (2) a coupling between variables on different sites of a regular lattice. Immediately generalisations present themselves: What if the variables have more components? What if we change the lattice? Make it disordered?
What is phenomenology?
