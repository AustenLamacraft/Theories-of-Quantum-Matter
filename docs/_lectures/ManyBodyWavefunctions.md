>We begin our study of many body quantum mechanics by examining a number of systems where eigenstates and eigenvalues may be found explicitly for any number of particles. Be warned that these situations are __highly atypical__ -- but are nevertheless very informative.

## Bosons and Fermions

Here we introduce..  $$\br,\bk,\bv,\adop \tr(ABC)$$ $$\cA$$

\begin{equation}
\Psi(\br_1,\br_2) =
\end{equation}

In this first section leave a note setting $$\hbar = 1$$ for the rest of the course...

### Product States

## The 1D Fermi Gas

### Ground State

### Excitation spectrum


Particle and hole excitations

Map out spectrum at fixed momentum


### Density Correlations

### Impenetrable Bose Gas

Although the Fermi gas is a noninteracting system, the above discussion allows us to say something about an interacting system, albeit a rather special one.

We consider 1D system described by the Hamiltonian



## Quantum Hall Effect

### Landau Levels

### The Laughlin wavefunction

### Fractional Charge

### Fractional Statistics

## Physical Quantities

Knowing the wavefunction $$\Psi(x_1,\ldots x_N)$$ of a many body system is one thing, but what to _do_ with it?



## Monte Carlo Simulation of Laughlin States

# Bose and Fermi Partition Functions

## Statistics of Bose Condensation
