chapter: 1
summary: Examples of the 1D Fermi gas, Calogero--Sutherland model, and Quantum Hall Effect.

>We begin our study of many body quantum mechanics by examining a number of systems where eigenstates and eigenvalues may be found explicitly for any number of particles. Be warned that these situations are __highly atypical__ -- but are nevertheless very informative.

## Bosons and Fermions

Here we introduce..  $$\br,\bk,\bv,\adop \tr(ABC)$$ $$\cA$$

\begin{equation}
\Psi(\br_1,\br_2) =
\end{equation}

### Physical Quantities

Knowing the wavefunction $$\Psi(x_1,\ldots x_N)$$ of a many body system is one thing, but what to _do_ with it?

## 1D Fermi gas

## The Impenetrable Bose Gas

Although the Fermi gas is a noninteracting system, the above discussion allows us to say something about an interacting system, albeit a rather special one.

We consider 1D system described by the Hamiltonian

## Calogero--Sutherland model

## Fermions in the lowest Landau level

### Monte Carlo simulation of Laughlin states

## Bose and Fermi partition functions

### Statistics of Bose condensation
