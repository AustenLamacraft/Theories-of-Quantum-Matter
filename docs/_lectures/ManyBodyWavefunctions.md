>We begin our study of many body quantum mechanics by examining a number of systems where eigenstates and eigenvalues may be found explicitly for any number of particles. Be warned that these situations are __highly atypical__ -- but are nevertheless very informative.

# Bosons and Fermions

Here we introduce..  $$\br,\bk,\bv,\adop \tr(ABC)$$ $$\cA$$

\begin{equation}
\Psi(\br_1,\br_2) =
\end{equation}

In this first section leave a note setting $$\hbar = 1$$ for the rest of the course...

## Physical Quantities

Knowing the wavefunction $$\Psi(x_1,\ldots x_N)$$ of a many body system is one thing, but what to _do_ with it?

# 1D Fermi Gas

## Ground State

## Excited States

Particle and hole excitations

Map out spectrum at fixed momentum

# the Impenetrable Bose Gas

Although the Fermi gas is a noninteracting system, the above discussion allows us to say something about an interacting system, albeit a rather special one.

We consider 1D system described by the Hamiltonian

# Calogero--Sutherland Model

# Fermions in the Lowest Landau Level

## Monte Carlo Simulation of Laughlin States

# Bose and Fermi Partition Functions

## Statistics of Bose Condensation
