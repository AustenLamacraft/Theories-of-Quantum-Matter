> There are many situations in condensed matter where one distinguished degree of freedom is coupled to many others. We have met one already -- the Kondo model -- in which one spin is coupled to an infinite Fermi sea. You are familiar with the idea of a (semi-) infinite string being used to model a real impedance, with energy being dissipated to infinity. The examples below can be regarded as quantum mechanical analogues of this situation.

## Quantum Hydrodynamics

This can be similar to my Obergurgl lectures

## Modelling a Dissipative Environment

You are familiar with the idea that that an infinite string can be described in terms of a real impedance.
