title: The Lieb-Liniger Model
author: Austen Lamacraft
chapter: 3
summary: Bethe's wave function; Impenetrable limit; Excited states and the classical limit.

>In this lecture we are going to look at a model of many interacting particles that we can solve __exactly__. The price we pay is that the model is rather special: it describes particles moving in one dimension with short range interactions.
