# Tight Binding Models

Matrix form. Solution by Fourier transformation. _circulant matrix_

# Bose--Hubbard model

## The Mott state

Getting at the phase boundaries for large $$U$$ by adding or removing a particle on top of the Mott state.

## The superfluid state

## The phase diagram

# (Fermi--)Hubbard model

## $$U\to\infty$$ and Superexchange

On account of their being more than one species of particle, the $$U\to\infty$$ limit of the Fermi--Hubbard model is not as straightforward as in the Bose case we considered earlier (Note that we are free to consider more than one species of Boson).

Should be cautious, as in a large system the energy spectrum of the Heisenberg model will exceed the separation from doubly occupied sites.

### Two sites

### Schrieffer--Wolf transformation
