\section{Problem Sheets}


We should have a problem sheet to go with each class

\subsection{Examples 1: Lectures 1-4}

All first quantization stuff
Lowering operators on vandermonde
Bethe ansatz attractive state
Relation to SEP
Schwinger bosons, classical version

\subsection{Examples 2: Lectures 5-8}

Matveev Yue Glazman
Chevy wavefunction

\subsection{Examples 3: Lectures 9-12}

Variational for Heisenberg's problem. When we do real space variational argument in the simplest way, the 2D version doesn't tell us anything. How does BCS avoid this issue?

Condensate fluctuations from Bogoliubov theory.

\subsection{Examples 4: Lectures 13-16}
