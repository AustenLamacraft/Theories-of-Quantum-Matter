\section{Problem Sheets}


We should have a problem sheet to go with each class

\subsection{Examples 1: Lectures 1-3}

All first quantization stuff
Lowering operators on vandermonde
Bethe ansatz attractive state
Relation to SEP
Schwinger bosons, classical version

\subsection{Examples 2: Lectures 4-7}

Matveev Yue Glazman
Chevy wavefunction

\subsection{Examples 3: Lectures 8-11}

Variational for Heisenberg's problem. When we do real space variational argument in the simplest way, the 2D version doesn't tell us anything. How does BCS avoid this issue?

\[\sum_i \alpha_i = N\]

\subsection{Examples 4: Lectures 12-16}
